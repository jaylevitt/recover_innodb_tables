Sometimes, we do something REALLY STUPID, and we end up with a MySQL InnoDB database without its .frm files.  Thanks to the innodb-tools project[1] and Chris Calender's helpful howto[2], all is not lost!

This is a crude wrapper to let you recover all the tables in one pass, per Chris's "recover based off the entire ibdata files" method.

Documentation is sorely lacking, as is design, but:

- Change the obvious globals to match your setup
- If you don't find them obvious, you shouldn't use this
- table_list should be a simple text file with a list of table names, one per line
- the output of "create_defs" is stored in the "defs/" directory, and create_defs is only
  run once. That way, you can tweak the defs to eliminate garbage records, and repeat as needed.
- I don't even know MySQL.  Use at your own risk.
